" if you can't code in assembly you don't know what the computer is doing " ~George hotz . ( Pascal Triangle Generator &amp; Monoalphabetic Substitution Encryption )

<br /> The first project inside the repo is a Monoalphabetic Substitution Encryption program 
<br /> In the monoalphabetic substitution encryption, each alphabetic letter is substituted by another letter according to the following table:
<br />

<br />The program encrypts the input message using the stored table, and decrypt the cipher text to obtain the original text message.

<br /> The second project inside the repo is a Pascal Triangle generator program 
<br /> In mathematics, Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients that arises in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra.To build the triangle, start with "1" at the top, then continue placing numbers below it in a triangular pattern.Each number is the numbers directly above it added together.
<br />The program computes the Pascal Triangle and displays it.
